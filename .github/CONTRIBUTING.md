## 1. Getting Started

### Ways to Contribute

> If you are new to open source, we recommend reading [GitHub's open source guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) and going through their [interactive courses](https://skills.github.com/).

Feel free to contribute to Latina Dev in one or more of the following ways and thank you for being willing to help out! 😊

- Tackle any of the [open issues](https://github.com/Latina-Dev/latina-dev/issues) that are labeled `help wanted`, `good first issue` or `hacktoberfest`.
  - If an issue has the label `in progress`, someone is already working on it.
  - If an issue has the label `admin`, an admin probably needs to get involved since it requires admin access.
  - **Even if an issue has someone assigned, it still might need extra help so leave a comment it appeals to you!**
- [Open a new issue](https://github.com/Latina-Dev/latina-dev/issues/new/choose)
- [Report a bug](https://github.com/Latina-Dev/latina-dev/issues/new?template=bug-report.md)
- [Request a new feature](https://github.com/Latina-Dev/latina-dev/issues/new?template=feature-request.md)
- Improve our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Latina-Dev/latina-dev/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) (this file)
- Improve our [Storybook](https://www.chromatic.com/library?appId=6472ce8643c60096810af8c0) which houses all our documentation and design system components

## 2. Local Development

### Fork the repo

[Fork](https://github.com/Latina-Dev/latina-dev/fork) this repository and clone it locally.

Connect your local to the original "upstream" repository by adding it as [a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/).

Pull in changes from "upstream" often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.

See more detailed instructions through this GitHub article called ["Syncing a Fork"](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).

### Installation

> If you've never used [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm#what-is-npm) before, we recommend following [these instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#installing-npm-from-the-nodejs-site) to get `npm` up and running properly.

```bash
npm i
```

This will install all the packages needed to run this website locally.

### Live Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

At this point, you are able to preview the website locally and can make changes to the source code.

## 3. Opening a Pull Request

- include a useful description of your PR after opening it
