                    <p>
                        As an open source project led by Latina software engineers, our mission is to empower Latinas in the tech industry and foster an
                        inclusive and supportive community. We recognize the importance of being a Latina and how it intertwines with our expertise in
                        software engineering and open source development.
                    </p>
                    <h3>About Us</h3>
                    <p>
                        A community for present & future Latina software engineers created to connect, elevate and empower the next generation of tech leaders.
                        Less than 15% of engineers are women; 2% are Latina. We want that to change! Latina Dev is an open-source directory of
                        Latina software engineers at the student, IC, and leadership levels.
                        Our goal is to increase visibility and access to valuable opportunities.
