## Logo

We decided to base our logo on the South American great horned owl that can be found throughout the Americas.

The owl is a symbol of wisdom and knowledge, a nod to our intersectional identity as Latina software engineers.

The owl is also a symbol of death and rebirth, a nod to our mission of helping Latinas transition into software engineering and thrive in their careers.
