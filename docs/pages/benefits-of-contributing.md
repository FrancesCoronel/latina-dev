## Credibility

- You can tell people you've contributed to an open source project - [not many developers do](https://www.digitalocean.com/currents/june-2022)!
- You can tell people you have contributed to the largest community for Latinx in Tech
- You can also tell people you've worked on a project that uses the cutting edge of front end technology (Next.js with App Router)
