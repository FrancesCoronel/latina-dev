## Ways to Contribute

> If you are new to open source, we recommend reading [GitHub's open source guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) and going through their [interactive courses](https://skills.github.com/).

Feel free to contribute to Latina Dev in one or more of the following ways and thank you for being willing to help out! ðŸ˜Š

- Tackle any of the [open issues](https://github.com/Latina-Dev/latina-dev/issues) that are labeled `help wanted`, `good first issue` or `hacktoberfest`.
  - If an issue has the label `in progress`, someone is already working on it.
  - If an issue has the label `admin`, an admin probably needs to get involved since it requires admin access.
  - **Even if an issue has someone assigned, it still might need extra help so leave a comment it appeals to you!**
